# PocketCheck

This project was created during the Girls Who Code summer immersion program at VMware in 2015. Our team used Swift to create this app.

**Description:**

This is a simple app that tracks an individual's spendings and budget in a log. With this app, users can either input the amount of money spent or take a picture of the receipt and have it automatically entered in. This easy to use app allows individuals to compare the amounts of money spent to the actual budget. In the calendar, one can view their spendings for one day, week, etc. The log categorizes the entries and displays the total amount spent, tax, and tip for each entry. Our pie chart allows users to view the amounts of money they spent in each category, and how close they are to their budget.
